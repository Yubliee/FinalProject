            <p class="text">So what is the deal with this "Jourm", anyway? Well, it all begins in the lab of the wizard, Oojaba. Oojaba has realized he is too old to set out for his own adventures, and decided to attempt to make a creature, to fulfill the goals he once set for himself, as to give him, and the creature, a feeling of achievement. Out of brewing potion, springs a tiny fluffball, named Jourm. He is inexperienced, and newly awakened to life, and is instructed by Oojaba to get out into the world, and make him proud. Jourm gladly begins his journey, starting from level one, and discoveres many things along the way which gains him experience and skills, usable for the upcoming levels. The very first thing he discovers, is that there are enemies which attempt to attack him. The first enemy he encounters is a purple, slimey looking guy, who seems to float towards him without making any noises. The enemie's arms are vibrating, almost as if Jourm will recieve an electric shock upon contact. Soon he will learn the right skills to defeat this purple, nasty looking guy. </p>

         <p class="text">Something else that Jourm will discover along his way and through his adventures, are not negative things such as enemies, but positive things, such as flowers! Jourm learns of the existence of two different types of flowers, namely a speed-boost flower, and a jump-boost flower. Consuming either of these will temporarily cause his floating light bulb to switch colors to the color of the flower, as well as gain him a speed- or jump boost, of course depending on which flower he has just consumed. The effect will last for a little bit, and then disappear, along with the color-change of his floating light bulb. After this his physical condition will remain as it did before, until he finds another flower.</p>

        <p class="text">At the end of each level, Jourm will have to get to a button which opens a door leading to the next level. In some cases, getting to the button involves challenges related to platformer-skills, such as being able to jump far- or high enough, calculating the best way to the button, etc. Other times the challenge will involve defeating monsters which guard the button. In some cases there will even be a puzzle of buttons, and the only way of moving on to the next level is figuring out the puzzle and pressing the buttons in the exact right order.</p>
