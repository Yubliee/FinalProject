            <p class="text">It all began in connection to a course for our highschool, where we got the opportunity to use our creativity and showcase our knowledge. We chose to make a game. Jourm's Journey is an adventurous platformer game created to appreaciate nature, as well as those around us. "Jourm", the main character, faces challenges through a series of levels, involving solving puzzles, fighting enemies and getting from point A to point B without dying. It may require focus, but if you have an eye for detail, you may notice a change through the levels which is crucial to the story of this game. It was originally created as a project for school, and the beta version is now playable for a peek into what we have been working on, and wish to complete some time in the near future. Through the game you explore themes of nature and biology, and through the story you learn about the values of the ones you love, and how important it is not to isolate yourself from them. These ideas are wrapped up into the game which we call "Jourm's Journey", available to download through the link on this page.</p>

         <p class="text">While there were two people working on this project, the tasks had been divided into several different areas, including art (by means of pixelart), music, level building, game lore, animations, a website for the game, and more. One of the most crucial parts to a platformer, specifically this platformer game which is heavily inspired by nature, is the tile set. A tile set is essentially building blocks that make up the world, the ground. The tile set consists of 9 tiles, and an additional four tiles for inbent corners, when needed. For this game, we decided the tile-set to resemble a sort of overgrown earth, where the leaves fall down and cover up parts of the earth, giving a feeling of existing in a society where civilization has long been gone.</p>

            Lastly, for a platformer such as this one, a crucial parts for many games of this type is the idea of a villain. Although it is not clear at first, the wizard, named "Oojaba", will upon completion of all but the last level, reveal himself to be the antagonist of the game, explaining to Jourm how his loneliness is not something only he should be tortured with, and reveals that he has been keeping Jourm too busy with his challenges for Jourm to notice how the life of the levels has started to disappear. He insists that in the end, Jourm has become as lonely as himself. The final challenge of the game becomes the goal of defeating Oojaba, which will restore life and love through the levels, and make Jourm able to experience happiness again.
