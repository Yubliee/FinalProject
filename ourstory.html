            <p class="text">So, who are the people behind this game? Let's discuss it. We are Jenny and Melker, two high school students who are on track to graduate during the summer of 2024. For our final project in school, where we were supposed to show our knowledge, we decided to make a game. The real goal was not as much about the contents of the game, but rather if we would be able to make one, based on what we have learned during our engineering program in highschool. In the end, the game did not become entirely finished, but definitely playable, and with a variety of characters and background detail, to bring more life into what we had managed to create so far. In the future we wish to work further on "Jourm's Journey", fully completing all levels, and finishing all animations and code, as well as sound effects and music. Wish us luck, and try out the early version of our game on the "Home" page!</p>

         <p class="text">A fun fact to know about this game, is the story of how the name "Jourm" came to be the name of the main character. It all started out when we were learning the pixel-art program, and how to design the characters in an appealing, sort of realistic way (shadowing, movement, etc). One of the very first things I did, just to test out the pen, was to draw a scribbe across the canvas in a white color. It turned out to look a little bit like some sort of creature, and as a model to practice on, i started coloring the creature with green shading, and finished the outline in white, as well as added some eyes and a mouth. When I was finished, and had to name the file, the first name that popped up was an unserious one, "Jourm", which I had seen as a mnemonic device for remembering a kanji while studying japanese. As it was not a serious character and I did not plan on incorporating it into the game, I didn't mind naming him something unserious. A while later, it had gotten to the time where I had designed the main character, all of his different movements and animations, but had not yet named him. We decided, on a whim, to honour the original green Jourm, as a token of our progress with the game, and name the main character exactly that, "Jourm". The original green Jourm later became incorporated into the game as one of the enemies you may encounter through the levels.</p>

        <p class="text">Creating this game has not only become "Jourm's Journey", but our journey as well. After working on the game for nearly an entire year, we have gained a large amount of knowledge and experience in coding and pixel-art, as well as the challenges and advantages of teamwork. We wish to finish this game in the future, and hopefully it can teach people to value their loved ones, and value nature just like Jourm always have, and always will!</p>
